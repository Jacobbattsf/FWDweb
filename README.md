# FWDweb
Front end web development website
3/9/2024 currently the goal is to make my semantic elements match the page layout.
holy wow I have added a lot of things today. time to take a break.
Tomorrow I will add content into all 3 cities.
Juneau will hold my 5x5 table
Anchorage will hold my ordered list
Sitka will hold my unordered list.
Goodnight vscode... my fingers are tired.

3/11/2024 I won't stop until I finish today, I want my city sites to be stylized in a VERY simplistic way. I am doing only what the requirements of asking for
but I also want to make it visually appealing (as much as a noob web dev can) I have made the main content of each page after requirement A 
I have also included travel links on each of my city sites so I could have an external link instead of making my nav bar my external links (yikes!)
I am finished with requirement A,C,D at this time. Time to make my tables and lists and submit this thang! - 9:01 AM on Monday.
